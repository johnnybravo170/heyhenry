# HeyHenry UX Redesign — Pipeline & Screen Status

**This is the single source of truth for the redesign pipeline. Every design/build session reads it FIRST and updates it on handoff.** It exists to kill the #1 time sink: re-discovering what's already done.

---

## The pipeline (three sessions, three lanes)

```
RESEARCH ───briefs──▶ OD DRIVER ───renders+cards──▶ CODING
(analysis)            (the bottleneck)               (the Mini)
```

| Session | Owns (writes) | Produces | Reads |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Research** | `docs/ux/briefs/*.md` + this tracker | grounded screen briefs (workflow analysis, current-vs-target, real-code grounding) | vault Module docs, real code, foundation docs |
| **OD Driver** | OD prompts, `od-*/` renders, **Dev cards** on the Ops `dev` board | hi-fi renders + critique + the build cards | the brief for the screen |
| **Coding** (Mini) | `src/**` + commits | the implemented screen | the brief + the render + the dev card |

**Lane discipline (this prevents the duplicate-work we hit):** one session owns each artifact type. Research writes **only briefs** (+ this tracker). OD Driver owns **prompts, renders, and dev cards**. Coding owns **commits to `src`**. Don't create dev cards from Research; don't write briefs from OD Driver. *(The duplicate Schedule card happened because card-creation wasn't lane-owned.)*

**Verified = the Coding done-gate (no separate QA session) — desktop AND mobile.** Before flipping a screen to ✅ Built, run `heyhenry-design-critique` against the **live built screen at BOTH a desktop and a phone viewport** (not the OD render). A screen isn't ✅ until its **mobile** pass clears against the brief's "Mobile vs desktop" section + the rubric's Mobile/field-viability dimension. Log residual design↔code variance as a Notes entry here + a follow-up card if material. Same critique skill, pointed at the app — keeps us to three lanes and off the OD-Driver bottleneck.

---

## Session-start protocol (do this every time, every session)

**0. Work in your OWN git worktree — never share one checkout.** Multiple agents on a single working copy race on git state — divergent commits, duplicate-SHA history, stash churn, even transient `rev-parse`/ref failures (we hit all of these). Each session gets its own worktree on its own branch:
```
git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<session> -b ux/<session> origin/main
cd .claude/worktrees/<session>
bash scripts/setup-worktree.sh   # symlinks .env files; idempotent
pnpm install                     # only if node_modules is empty
```
Research / OD Driver / Coding each run in a separate worktree so they never step on each other. See `AGENTS.md` §"Working in a worktree". *(The Coding/Mini lane already works on PR branches — this brings the design lanes in line.)*

> **⚠ OD Driver caveat — the worktree doesn't isolate renders.** The OD daemon writes renders to its project's *fixed* `baseDir`, so a fresh per-session worktree never receives them — they land in whatever checkout the daemon points at. So the OD Driver lane keeps **one stable checkout = the daemon's `baseDir`** (don't recreate it per session) and stays clear of the other sessions with `git pull --rebase` before every commit/push — scope commits to `od-*/` renders + this file's cell (Ops `dev` cards aren't git, so no race there). The ephemeral `ux/<session>` worktree is really a **Coding-lane** device — it isolates `src/` edits, which the OD Driver doesn't make. To isolate the OD Driver fully, point the daemon at a dedicated persistent OD checkout and leave it there.

1. **`git pull --rebase origin main`** — never work stale. (Most cross-session mixups this arc came from a stale checkout.)
2. **Read this file** — find your screen's row; confirm the upstream stage is done before you start yours.
3. **Work only your lane's artifact.**
4. **On handoff, update this file** — flip your stage's cell + drop the ref (commit SHA / card id / render path). Commit it with your work.
5. **Transport is git + the Ops board, not copy-paste.** Briefs live in `docs/ux/briefs/`, renders in `od-*/`, cards on the `dev` board (`epic:ux-redesign`). Read from there; the human is a checkpoint, not the courier. *(OD step is going headless via the `od-redesign-loop` skill.)*

**Claim before you start (two research agents now run in parallel).** Before working a screen, mark its **Brief** cell `🟡 (in progress: <your-session>)` and commit that line — so two researchers never write the same brief. Flip to ✅ when you hand off. Same rule for any lane picking up a screen.

## Untouched screens — menu for the next research pass
> ✅ **Sweep complete — `research-0523` (2026-05-23) briefed every actionable screen on this menu.** Promoted into the tables above with briefs: **Business Health** (`business-health.md`), **Quotes** (`quotes.md`), **Settings** (`settings.md`), **Project secondary tabs / Photos·Documents·Notes** (`project-secondary-tabs.md`), **Worker app `/w`** (`worker-app.md`), **Public pages** (`public-pages.md`). The only remaining item is intentionally deferred:

- **Bookkeeper portal** (`/bk`) — **deferred, out of redesign scope for V1 — confirmed by the sweep.** Real + shipped, but scoped out by Role × Object Matrix `03b1ccf4` (`/bk` financial-only, "out of redesign scope"), Object Model `b4d880be` (Bookkeeper-domain tables out of scope), and Workflow Library `e0263cc3` (#8 Bookkeeper Review — deferred, separate portal). Revisit only if it re-enters scope.

**Gaps surfaced during the sweep — all addressed:**
- **Project → Selections tab** — found un-briefed during the sweep, **now briefed** (`selections.md`, 2026-05-23) and promoted into the Project Hub table above.

## Scope ledger — the honest done-line (2026-05-23)
The redesign-scope surface is briefed; everything else is explicitly classified.

**Graduated heavy flows — briefed ✅** (sub-flows that earned their own brief out of a screen's Subscreen Inventory):
`invoice-detail.md` (`/invoices/[id]`) · `bank-reconciliation.md` (import + review) · `home-record.md` (closeout) · `settings-team.md` · `settings-billing.md` · `settings-quickbooks.md` (QBO hub, 4 routes) · `settings-import.md`. Most are built/live (pre-Paper) → OD render + restyle next; bank-recon + home-record carry build deltas flagged in-brief. *(`<CustomerDocument>` shell → `customer-documents.md` + render `od-customer-documents` + card `1f5cd745`.)*

**Onboarding + Referrals — now briefed ✅** (2026-05-23, closing the last GC gaps):
- **Onboarding** → `onboarding.md` — a NEW light first-run setup pass (`(auth)/onboarding` doesn't exist today; signup → `/dashboard`). Lower build urgency (no firm launch date).
- **Referrals** → `referrals.md` — built/live → repaint; the reward/payout pipeline is vaporware (flagged, graduates). V1.1-candidate.

**Out of redesign scope (intentionally not briefed):**
- **Bookkeeper portal** (`/bk`) — deferred (see the sweep note above; Role Matrix `03b1ccf4` / Workflow #8).
- **`admin`** (internal ops UI) · **`social`** (ops marketing drafts) · **`lead-gen` + `leads`** (PW-vertical public lead capture; GC leads = Contacts) · **legacy `jobs` + PW quotes** (`quotes.md` maps the PW→GC boundary; GC uses Projects).
- **Owner Dashboard** (`dashboard.md`) — owner optimizes on a separate track ("don't touch").

**Net:** **every GC-V1 redesign surface is now briefed — zero in-scope gaps.** Remaining work is downstream per screen (OD render → build → the ✅-verify gate) plus the explicitly out-of-scope set above (Bookkeeper `/bk`, `admin`, `social`, `lead-gen`/`leads`, legacy `jobs`/PW quotes, owner Dashboard).

## Cross-cutting items
- **"client" not "homeowner" terminology sweep** — Ops decision `1d055427`; dev card `2eab19b2` (12 briefs + sacred-path + vault Role × Object Matrix `03b1ccf4` + the 2 design skills). Folded into the reconciliation pass. Keep "customer" for data/product terms.
- **OD→build contract:** `docs/ux/HANDOFF-TO-BUILD.md` (tokens + class names + data bindings so builds don't drift from screenshots).
- **Subscreen-inventory backfill — ✅ COMPLETE** (2026-05-23) across all 13 briefed screens (Schedule · Client · Overview · Estimate · Change-Order · Invoices · Contacts · Expenses · Calendar · Projects-list · Inbox · Customer-Documents · Project-Hub) — each brief now carries a `## Subscreen inventory`. **Graduates — both handled:** `/invoices/[id]` now has its own brief + row (`invoice-detail.md`); the `<CustomerDocument>` shared shell is specced in `customer-documents.md` (render `od-customer-documents` + build card `1f5cd745`) — a shared-component (PATTERNS) extraction, not a separate brief. New screens get their inventory inline via the skill's Subscreen-Inventory step.
- **Mobile audit sweep** (cross-cutting — run per build-batch; **NOT a standing lane**): drive the live app (`app.heyhenry.io`, tenant **Maple Ridge Renos** / `gcdemo@example.com`) at phone widths. Check the **app-wide** mobile patterns once — nav collapse (`<select>`) · worker `/w` bottom-nav · ≥44px tap targets · safe areas · sticky bars · overflow/clipping · capture-first flows — plus each built screen against its brief's "Mobile vs desktop" section; file Dev cards for findings. Emulated-mobile (narrow viewport via the Chrome MCP) catches layout / spec / tap-target / overflow drift; a human on-device spot-check stays for true touch / iOS-Safari / perf.

## How to update this doc
When you finish your stage for a screen: flip the cell (⬜→🟡→✅), add the ref (commit/card/render path), and commit `PIPELINE.md` alongside your work. If you discover a cell is wrong, fix it — it's only useful if it's true. **Subscreens count:** a screen isn't fully designed until its Subscreen Inventory is done (skill step 8) — track it in the row's Notes (e.g. `subscreens: 🟡 3/6 specced`), and don't mark a screen ✅ Built+Verified with un-specced heavy subscreens. Foundation docs + skills: `docs/ux/HANDOFF.md`, `docs/ux/README.md`, `.claude/skills/heyhenry-*`.
